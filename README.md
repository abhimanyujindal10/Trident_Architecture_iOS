# Trident_Architecture_iOS

## What is Trident Architecture?
It is the set of rules for the application development. This architecture helps to make code flexible and make the libraries to be integrated as per your project needs than changing your project as per the library provided.

## Why Trident?
Using this architecture, one can scale up, scale down, add/update/switch libraries and reuse the already created module in any project. It gives the code flexibility, reusablility and scalability without depending on the libraries.

### Based on Projects
- **Long Term Projects** - You need not to couple your project with your current libraries. You can switch any library any time without affecting your core logic.

- **Short Term Projects** - This structure lets you reuse the modules right away without re-inventing the wheel again. You or your company gets a new project, just review the modules that can be installed and your project is ready to deploy. More you code, less you give estima

### Based on Time

- Now start integrating screens, webservices, APNS, DB interaction in no time. Your estimates for development will reduce to half if you use this architecure. It means more projects in less time without compromising quality.

### Based on Team

- No hassle of abusing data by different team members. Now, no duplicate logics by different team members for different screens.

### Others

- Identify and fix bugs in no time.
- Loosely coupled code along with loosely coupled libraries.
- Extensive support to switch to any required library.

## How to implement?

There are very basic simple rules to follow. If you follow them properly, you will never get
